Shamelessly stolen from Tacospin, not that other spin we won't speak of.

I didn't commit the sound file because I'm not trying to get sued. If you
happen to have a copy of "Killing in the Name" by Rage Against the Machine
you should totally drop it in the assets folder and update the path to the
audio file.

Or use something different it's open source idc.
